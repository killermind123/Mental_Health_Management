Instruction on how to run application:
To install and run the Admin, Doctor, and Patient Management System on your local computer using XAMPP, follow these instructions.

Install XAMPP first.
Install XAMPP by downloading it from Apache Friends.
Launch the XAMPP Control Panel by opening:
Apache (for HTML and PHP files)
MySQL (for database)

Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ to launch phpMyAdmin. Then, choose Databases â†’ Make a new database with the name admin_panel.
To create tables, select the SQL tab and execute the script below:
SQL
Copy and Edit the admin user table
FORM TABLE admin (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL);

-- Table for doctors
CREATE TABLE doctors (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,

    die("Database connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
